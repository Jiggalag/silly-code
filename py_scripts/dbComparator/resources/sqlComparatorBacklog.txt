UI Bugfixes:

1. Move test-connection modal window nearly to center.
2. Add alignment to line edit fields.
3. Hide advanced settings. Probably, move it to different window.
4. UI hangs and disables during comparing DBs. Add modal window with progress bar and some information about
progress of comparing.
5. Add "Check only reports" flag in UI. Support it on backend.

Bugs:

1. There are some fields in header of dumped file but only one field in data for page table on marvin.

Epics:
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.
