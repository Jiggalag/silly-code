Enchancements:

1. Add try/except construction in case of defining non-existent columns/tables.
2. We shouldn't run describe query on skipped tables.
3. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection.
4. Implement correct working of table timeout (probably, we should stop query, if timeout falls).
5. Great UI refactoring - move different element groups to different classes.
6. Add verification case when entities and reports flag disabled at same time.
7. Disable checking mode group if "Only reports flag" disabled.
8. UI hangs and disables during comparing DBs. Add modal window with progress bar and some information about
progress of comparing. Probably, we should generate all sql-queries before running and use this queries to calculate
comparing progress.
9. Hide advanced settings. Probably, move it to different window.
10. Probably remove Schema columns field, and move this data to hardcode.
-> 11. Add scrollable list with checkboxes to fields "Only tables", "Skip tables" and "Skip columns".
12. Remove Check connection buttons.

Bugs:

1. There are some fields in header of dumped file but only one field in data for page table on marvin.

Epics:
1. Present summary information more flexible.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.
