Epics:
1. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.

Backlog:

1. Present summary information more flexible.

Enchancement:

1. UI hangs and disaples during comparing DBs. Add modal window with progress bar and some information about
progress of comparing.
2. Add stage for final comparing of differences for each table. Differences should be added to sets to make comparing easier.
We need this stage to exclude situations, when same entities fonded in differents compare-packs.
