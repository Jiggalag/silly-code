Backlog:

2. Support onlyEntitiesCheck property?
3. Support onlyReportsCheck property?
5. Support quickCheck property, which enables quick-check mode. Tables would be compared by short case (first N, where N = amountCheckingRecords record).
6. Present summary information more flexible.
7. Add opportunity of writing to log file in loggerHelper.

Epics:
1. Add UI.
2. Probably, add functional for cloning databases.
